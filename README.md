## üß∞ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- Java 17
- Maven
- MySQL, other databases will work as well, JPA makes it easy to integrate any database (See resources at bottom)
- Git

---

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kphit03/LearnADC.git
cd LearnADC
```

### 2. Setup the Backend

```bash
cd learnadc-backend
```

- Configure `application.properties` or `application.yml` with your MySQL credentials.
- Create a MySQL database named `learnadc`.
- The environment variables `JWT_SECRET` and `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` must also be filled out for full functionality. This application uses SMTP with gmail.
- Visit: `http://localhost:8080` or whichever default endpoint your local backend is pointed to.
- (Optional) You can deploy this anyway you'd like, but I deployed the backend via AWS EC2 and RDS.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Setup the Frontend

```bash
cd ../learnadc-frontend
npm install
ng serve 
```

- Setup your `environment.prod.ts` (Optional) or `environment.ts` variables to route to `http://localhost:8080`, or to your production API endpoint when deploying.
- Visit: `http://localhost:4200` to test frontend functionality
